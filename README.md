Salary Prediction Model Using Machine Learning
Description
This project focuses on predicting employee salaries using various machine learning algorithms based on features such as years of experience, position, department, and location. The goal is to develop a model that accurately forecasts salaries to assist in HR decisions and salary negotiations.

The project utilizes three different regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree. Each model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to determine their effectiveness.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and removes outliers.
Model Training: Implements multiple regression techniques to predict salaries.
Model Evaluation: Compares model performance using various metrics.
Future Salary Predictions: Provides functionality to predict future salaries based on employee experience.
This project serves as a practical example of applying machine learning techniques to real-world data and offers insights into salary trends across different roles and departments.
