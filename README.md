Data Overview
The dataset contains features such as Salary, Years_of_Experience, Position, Department, and more.
Summary statistics and visualizations are included in the analysis.
Models
Linear Regression: Used for baseline predictions.
Random Forest: An ensemble method for improved accuracy.
Decision Tree: Provides interpretability in predictions.
Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Future Predictions
The project includes functionality to predict future salaries based on years of experience.
